This is the beginning of a weather app for the command line to display weather information.

It is a app for personal use both as an excuse to explore GoLang and to allow me to get the weather without needing to use a browser or external device (like a phone)

You are welcome to use it but it is extremely unfinished at this time.

I will continue to work on it and provide a more full readme in time.
