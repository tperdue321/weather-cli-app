This is the beginning of a weather app for the command line to display weather information.

It is an app for personal use both as an excuse to explore GoLang, and to allow me to get the weather without needing to use a browser or external device (like a phone). Better apps like this already exist. This is a personal project that I am improving over time.

You are welcome to use it but it is unfinished at this time.

I will continue to work on it and provide a more full readme on it's full capabilities and requirements for it to function in time when such features are more fleshed out.
